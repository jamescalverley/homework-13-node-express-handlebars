## Project Title
Homework-13-Node-Express-Handlebars

## Project Description
This project involved building both the front-end and back-end components for a simple web app. By creating a mySQL database the burger table stores all the information for the front-end. Through the UI, the user is able to add a new burger, devour each of the burgers, view a list of devoured burgers and reset the entire table. Using HTML routes, the burger list is passed from the db to the server and then rendered on the client side. Then once the burger is devoured the "devoured" status of the burger changes from false to true and re-renders on the devoured list. 

## Next Steps
The handlebars section of this project still needs to be completed. Currently the front-end is rendered using regualr HTML. Another improvement for this project would be to create user accounts so a user could sign in with an email address and password to access their own personal menu.
